# Open Blog Directory

There are many blogrolls, but only one where you are in control of the data. Make a PR with your blog, use the data yourself - it's all open!

# Adding Your Blog

You can add your blog by simply making a PR against list.yaml and appending your blog's name, url, rss link, and tags. I will review it and mash merge, after the automated tests pass. I will reject PRs that delete or modify existing blogs in the list.
